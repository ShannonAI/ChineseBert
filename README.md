## Introduction
We propose ChineseBERT, which incorporates both the glyph and pinyin information of Chinese
characters into language model pretraining.  
 
First, for each Chinese character, we get three kind of embedding.
 - **Char Embedding:** the same as origin BERT token embedding.
 - **Glyph Embedding:** capture visual features based on different fonts of a Chinese character.
 - **Pinyin Embedding:** capture phonetic feature from the pinyin sequence ot a Chinese Character.
 
Then, char embedding, glyph embedding and pinyin embedding 
are first concatenated, and mapped to a D-dimensional embedding through a fully 
connected layer to form the fusion embedding.   
Finally, the fusion embedding is added with the position embedding, which is fed as input to the BERT model.  
The following image shows an overview architecture of ChineseBERT model.

ChineseBERT leverages the glyph and pinyin information of Chinese 
characters to enhance the model's ability of capturing
context semantics from surface character forms and
disambiguating polyphonic characters in Chinese.

## Quick tour
We train our model with Huggingface, so the model can be easily loaded.  
Download ChineseBERT model and save at `[CHINESEBERT_PATH]`.  
Here is a quick tour to load our model. 
```
>>> from models.modeling_glycebert import GlyceBertForMaskedLM

>>> chinese_bert = GlyceBertForMaskedLM.from_pretrained([CHINESEBERT_PATH])
>>> print(chinese_bert)
```
The complete example can be find here: 
[Masked word completion with ChineseBERT](tasks/language_model/README.md)

Another example to get representation of a sentence:
```
>>> from datasets.bert_dataset import BertDataset
>>> from models.modeling_glycebert import GlyceBertModel

>>> tokenizer = BertDataset([CHINESEBERT_PATH])
>>> chinese_bert = GlyceBertModel.from_pretrained([CHINESEBERT_PATH])
>>> sentence = 'æˆ‘å–œæ¬¢çŒ«'

>>> input_ids, pinyin_ids = tokenizer.tokenize_sentence(sentence)
>>> length = input_ids.shape[0]
>>> input_ids = input_ids.view(1, length)
>>> pinyin_ids = pinyin_ids.view(1, length, 8)
>>> output_hidden = chinese_bert.forward(input_ids, pinyin_ids)[0]
>>> print(output_hidden)
